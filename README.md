## Scatter plots

A scatter plot is a type of data visualization that shows the relationship between different variables. This data is shown by placing various data points between an x- and y-axis.

## Customize the scatter points in the chart
We can customize the chart’s scatter points using the [ShapeType](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.FastScatterBitmapSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_FastScatterBitmapSeries_ShapeType), [Interior](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Interior), [ScatterHeight](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.FastScatterBitmapSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_FastScatterBitmapSeries_ScatterHeight), [ScatterWidth](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.FastScatterBitmapSeries.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_FastScatterBitmapSeries_ScatterWidth), and [Label](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.ChartSeriesBase.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_ChartSeriesBase_Label) properties in the [FastScatterBitmapSeries](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.FastScatterBitmapSeries.html?tabs=tabid-1).

## Customize the legends in the chart
Legends help us easily understand the different categories in the data set. You can customize the legend in the WPF scatter chart using the [ItemTemplate](https://help.syncfusion.com/wpf/charts/legend#customization) property in the ChartLegend
